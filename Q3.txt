In file p3.py, some train and test data (x,y) is generated using predefined functions. Perform muliple linear regression (of polynomial order 5) using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm for estimation of non-linear curve parameters. Try to use the concept of decay and mini-batch while doing gradient descent. Show the results in the form of a graph. Write a function to calculate the R-squared goodness of fit value of your model. Comment on the calculated R-squared value.
